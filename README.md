# Onsets

API to power **OffSets**.

**_OffSets_** is a revival of a defunct poetry game from 2004 or so, devised, designed, administered and executed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Joyce">Trevor Joyce</a>.

The original system was largely hand/hardcoded, and has been offline for some years. This revival aims to recreate the original spirit and functionality of the game but in a more automated and easier to maintain way.
